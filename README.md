# CodeHive's Markdown WYSIWYG toolbar

This is the Markdown WYSIWYG toolbar found on [CodeHive](https://www.codehive.io). We've extracted some of our code base so that others can see how we did it and learn from it.

We also know that this toolbar is far form being perfect, so we'd love to get your help. You can find a version of it [over at CodePen](http://codepen.io/michaellee/pen/JdbqGW/). Feel free to fork it, make changes and let us know what you've done to it in the comments. That way we can update our Pen and credit you for the changes.

You can also fork this repo, which has the most current codebase. Improve it, change it and then create a pull request and we'll review and merge it into our repo and push it out to [CodeHive.io](https://www.codehive.io).
